Description: The usage of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect copy number variation (CNV) is widely accepted in cancer research. AluScanCNV2 is an R package that integrates cross-platform CNV detection from NGS data for the purpose of CNV-based tumor prediction. Based on the AluScanCNV software developed by us previously, this software detects CNVs from sequencing data obtained through whole-genome sequencing, AluScan or other targeted next-generation sequencing platforms. It enables usage of CNVs detected in a test subject’s germline genome to predict the subject’s susceptibility to cancer.
